# Performance Analysis
The F12 tooling included within Microsoft Edge can be used to analyze the performance of a web site. It allows similar capabilities to the Windows Performance Toolkit (WPT) and is integrated with the browser. More information on F12 can be found at [F12 Performance](..\..\f12-devtools-guide). 

The Microsoft Edge team uses the Windows Performance Toolkit (WPT) for analyzing many aspects of the browser's performance. WPT was created by the Windows team to allow any program's performance to be analyzed in depth. It breaks through the boundaries between a web site's JavaScript and Microsoft Edge's native code allowing both to be viewed within the same tool. It can be used to measure CPU time taken for software to complete work, to calculate the memory allocated by software, to show the details of downloading files from remote servers and to measure frame rate. More information on utilizing WPT to analyze a web site's performance in Microsoft Edge can be found at [Windows Performance Toolkit](windows-performance-toolkit).
